# BinaryTree
A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children. The logical representation of the above tree is given below: In the above tree, node 1 contains two pointers, i.e., left and a right pointer pointing to the left and right node respectively. The node 2 contains both the nodes ; therefore, it has two pointers. The nodes 3, 5 and 6 are the leaf nodes, so all these nodes contain NULL pointer on both left and right parts.
